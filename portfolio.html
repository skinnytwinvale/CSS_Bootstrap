        <p class="col-4">A data extraction project involves the process of collecting and retrieving data from various
            sources and converting it into a usable format. The project typically begins with identifying the data
            sources, such as databases, websites, or documents, and determining the specific information to be
            extracted. The extraction process can involve the use of software tools or manual techniques, and may
            include cleaning and transforming the data to ensure consistency and accuracy. Once the data is extracted,
            it can be analyzed and used for various purposes, such as business intelligence, research, or
            decision-making. The success of a data extraction project relies on careful planning, efficient execution,
            and proper data management practices.</p>

        <p class="col-4">Java is a popular programming language that is widely used for developing a variety of
            applications, including web applications, mobile apps, desktop applications, and enterprise software. Java
            is known for its platform independence, meaning that once code is written in Java, it can be run on any
            platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. This makes Java a highly portable and versatile
            language.</p>

        <p class="col-4">Creating a website using Java typically involves using a web framework such as Spring or Struts
            to build the server-side components of the website. This involves creating Java classes that handle incoming
            HTTP requests, process data, and generate dynamic web pages using technologies such as JavaServer Pages
            (JSP) or Thymeleaf.</p>
