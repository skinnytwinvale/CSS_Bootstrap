# CSS_Bootstrap

Twitter Bootstrap is a CSS framework built and maintained for free by Twitter. It's a collection of style rules and additional tools to help build responsive layouts faster.

Twitter Bootstrap offers a responsive grid, many default styles for buttons, typography, tables, forms, and much more. It also has a small JavaScript library for interactive components like dropdowns, carousels and more.

You can include Bootstrap by:
copy and paste the CDN link tag into your HTML file and you will have Bootstrap right away!

You've probably noticed that the link tag you copy from the Bootstrap site has some attributes we haven't seen before: integrity and crossorigin. These attributes provide a layer of security when
requesting files from a CDN, through a feature called Subresource Integrity. 

CDN stands for Content Delivery Network, and it's essentially a network of servers that are used to deliver content to users around the globe. Having a network of servers makes that delivery faster, because you can deliver content from whichever server is geographically closest to the user. It also provides a safeguard in case one of the servers goes down.
